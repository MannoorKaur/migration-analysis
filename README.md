# Migration and Cultural Diversity: An Analytical Comparison Between Australia and New Zealand

**CITS2402 – Introduction to Data Science**

This project analyzes migration trends and cultural diversity in **Australia** and **New Zealand** using official census datasets. The focus is on three key demographic indicators:  
- **Migration patterns**
- **Languages spoken at home**
- **Religious affiliations**

We applied the full data science lifecycle: from data collection and cleaning to analysis and visualization.


##  Research Question

> How has migration shaped cultural diversity in Australia and New Zealand, as seen through net migration, languages spoken at home, and religious affiliations?


##  Data Sources

- **Australia**: [Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)](https://www.abs.gov.au/)
- **New Zealand**: [Stats NZ](https://www.stats.govt.nz/)

All datasets used were publicly available and transformed into CSV format for analysis.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
  - `pandas` for data wrangling
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` for visualization
  - `numpy` for numerical processing
- Jupyter Notebook (Colab)


##  Summary of Work

- Standardized and cleaned inconsistent census data from both countries
- Refactored messy ETL pipelines to extract top trends
- Visualized net migration, top languages, and religious distributions
- Compared 2016–2021 (Australia) and 2013–2018 (New Zealand) to explore cultural evolution
